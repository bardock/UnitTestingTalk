# Philosophy

* Test First or Last?
* Tests or Examples? / Specification By Example?
* Test-by-Test or All-At-Once?
* Outside-In or Inside-Out?
* State or Behavior Verification?
* Fixture Design Up Front or Test-by-Test?

---
## Our Philosophy
* Write the tests first!
* Tests are examples!
* List all the customer tests cases and then write tests one at a time
* Outside-In Development helps clarify what tests are needed for the next layer inwards
* Primarily State Verification (page X) but Behavior Verification (page X) when needed to get good code coverage
* Use the smallest and simplest fixture possible for each test
Provide a base fixture setup with conventions used in most tests
