# Goals of Test Automation

template: goals-header

## Why Test

* Writing good test code is hard and maintaining obtuse test code is even harder
* Since test code is optional (not what the customer is paying for), there is a strong temptation to give up testing when the tests becomes difficult or expensive to maintain.

## Economics

* Of course there is will always be a cost to building and maintaining an automated test suite. 
* it is worth spending more to have the ability to change the software later
(The argument that the quality improvement is worth the extra cost often doesn't go very far either in these days of "just good enough" software quality).
* Our goal should be to make the decision to do test automation a "no-brainer" by ensuring that it does not increase the cost of software development. 
* This means that the additional cost of building and maintaining automated tests must be offset by savings through reduced manual unit testing and debugging/troubleshooting 
* As well as the remediation cost of the defects that would have gone undetected
